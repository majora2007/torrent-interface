# Torrent-Interface
Torrent-Interface is a project that contains executables that can be called from supporting torrent clients (ie uTorrent) when a state change occurs on a torrent. Information is passed to the torrent_script.py file and from there any script inside userscripts/ are executed. 

This interface allows userscripts to communicate back with the torrent client through a Web API on port 5000. I have provided two examples of what can be done.


## Todo
1. Add setup steps
2. Enhance microservice to provide more functionality.
3. Add support for other torrent clients.
4. Refactor code
